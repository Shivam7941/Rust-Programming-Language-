// So, this is our first program


fn main() { //fn stands for function and it's how you define a function in Rust

//main is a special function and the entry point of every Rust program
    
    println!("Hello, world!"); //println! - It stands for print line
    
    //println! has ! - it's a macro that gets expanded before compilation

    println!("This is my first Rust program !");

    // so this is the a basic program for hello world in rust
